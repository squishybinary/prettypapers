		<p>What comes to your mind when you</p><p>hear the word ‘‘extinction?’’ Perhaps you</p><p>imagine a critically endangered Giant</p><p>Panda gnawing on bamboo or a tiger</p><p>crouching in the brush amidst the seemly</p><p>endless degradation of their habitats. Or</p><p>perhaps you imagine herds of dinosaurs</p><p>and other creatures that we only know</p><p>from fossils that are millions of years old.</p><p>Odds are pretty good that an image of a</p><p>plant wasn’t the first (or the second, third,</p><p>or fourth) thing to pop into your head.</p><p>And yet, there are about as many plant</p><p>species as animals species that are consid-</p><p>ered to be</p><p>critically endangered by</p><p>extinction (and there would probably be</p><p>many more if the data were available).</p><p>And what about the Chicxulub impact,</p><p>the massive asteroid that collided with the</p><p>Earth about 66 million years ago and</p><p>almost certainly instigated the mass ex-</p><p>tinction that drove the non-avian dino-</p><p>saurs and about 75% of the species on the</p><p>planet extinct? Well, it turns out that this</p><p>impact, at</p><p>the boundary between the</p><p>Cretaceous (K) and Paleogene (Pg) peri-</p><p>ods, has been implicated in the extinction</p><p>of approximately half of all plant species</p><p>that existed in North America at the time.</p><p>There are two roads to extinction. First,</p><p>a species can go extinct simply because of</p><p>bad ‘‘luck.’’ Perhaps a species experiences</p><p>a few years of poor reproduction and is</p><p>then subject to a freak storm that causes</p><p>high mortality of the few individuals left.</p><p>As an analogy, think of gambling at the</p><p>slot machines, which involves no skill or</p><p>predictability in winning or losing. You</p><p>walk to a machine with a handful of coins</p><p>and, more often than not, you walk away a</p><p>few minutes</p><p>later empty-handed. The</p><p>second road to extinction happens when</p><p>a species’ traits are poorly matched to its</p><p>environment and that species’ ability to</p><p>replace itself</p><p>through reproduction is</p><p>outpaced by its mortality rate. A sudden</p><p>shift in climate, for example, can create a</p><p>hostile environment for species that were</p><p>once well suited to a particular location,</p><p>and they must either migrate towards</p><p>Selected PLOS Biology research articles are accom-</p><p>panied by a synopsis written for a general audience</p><p>to provide non-experts with insight</p><p>into the</p><p>significance of the published work.</p><p>Figure 1.

To go back to the gambling analogy,</p><p>a poker player whose skills are poorly</p><p>matched to others at the table will rapidly</p><p>go broke despite the random likelihood of</p><p>being dealt a good hand on occasion.</p><p>that</p><p>So, what happened after the Chicxulub</p><p>impact on what</p><p>is now the Yucatan</p><p>Peninsula 66 million years ago? Were the</p><p>few winners</p><p>survived the mass</p><p>extinction event just lucky? Or did they</p><p>have traits</p><p>somehow made them</p><p>better suited to survive the decades-long</p><p>impact winter that followed? And if the</p><p>latter, which traits were</p><p>favored or</p><p>disfavored? Ecologists studying contem-</p><p>porary extinctions have been asking these</p><p>sorts of questions for decades and have</p><p>that</p><p>devised a number of statistical tools to</p><p>disentangle the two roads towards extinc-</p><p>tion. However, similar approaches have</p><p>not been so forthcoming in paleoecology,</p><p>in which data are often incomplete. In</p><p>this issue of PLOS Biology, Blonder and</p><p>colleagues overcome this barrier by com-</p><p>bining modern ecological approaches</p><p>with data from a diverse and exception-</p><p>ally well-preserved set of fossilized plant</p><p>leaves from North Dakota (United States)</p><p>that spanned a 2.2 million-year period</p><p>bracketing the K–Pg mass extinction</p><p>event (Figure 1).</p><p>The primary goal of Blonder and</p><p>colleagues’ work was to determine whether</p><p>plant</p><p>that went extinct during</p><p>the K–Pg mass extinction event were</p><p>species</p><p>non-random with respect to their traits</p><p>relative to those that persisted. Taking</p><p>their cue from studies on extant plant</p><p>species and their distributions, Blonder</p><p>and colleagues measured two key plant</p><p>leaf</p><p>traits—leaf mass per area (LMA,</p><p>indicating the amount of carbon invested</p><p>per leaf area) and leaf minor vein density</p><p>(VD, indicating the ability to move carbon</p><p>and water in and out of</p><p>leaves)—on</p><p>hundreds of fossilized plant leaves. These</p><p>two traits provide insights into where a</p><p>given plant</p><p>is along the ‘‘leaf</p><p>economics spectrum.’’ On the one hand,</p><p>leaves can be ‘‘fast return,’’ indicated by</p><p>relatively low LMA and high VD; these</p><p>leaves are relatively cheap to make and</p><p>can allow plants to take up resources</p><p>rapidly when conditions are favorable</p><p>(e.g., warmer and wetter) but are lost</p><p>(along with their energetic maintenance</p><p>costs) when conditions are less favorable.</p><p>This</p><p>strategy is exemplified by many</p><p>deciduous species that acquire resources</p><p>in variable environments. On the other</p><p>hand, they can be ‘‘slow return,’’ indicated</p><p>by higher LMA and lower VD; these are</p><p>more costly to make and are longer lived.</p><p>Species on this end of the spectrum tend to</p><p>live in less variable environments and are</p><p>often evergreen.</p><p>Blonder and colleagues estimated the</p><p>VD and LMA of leaf fossil assemblages</p><p>starting around 1.4 million years before</p><p>the K–Pg boundary and going up to 0.8</p><p>million years after it. They found a more</p><p>than 10% decrease in the average LMA</p><p>and a nearly 70% decrease in its variance</p><p>across the K–Pg boundary, mostly because</p><p>species with particularly high LMA that</p><p>were abundant in the Cretaceous largely</p><p>disappeared in the Paleogene. On the</p><p>other hand,</p><p>they found a nearly 30%</p><p>increase in the VD of the plant assemblage</p><p>across the boundary (but no change in</p><p>variance), and this occurred primarily</p><p>because of a loss of species with low VD</p><p>that lived during the Cretaceous but went</p><p>extinct during the K–Pg event. Both of</p><p>these results are consistent with a hypoth-</p><p>esis that the lower light levels and high</p><p>climatic variability that resulted from the</p><p>impact winter after the bolide impact</p><p>resulted in a directional</p><p>towards</p><p>species with fast strategies (low LMA,</p><p>high VD) and away from species with</p><p>slower strategies (i.e., angiosperms that</p><p>are evergreen, such as holly and rhodo-</p><p>dendrons).</p><p>shift</p><p>themselves. Cretaceous</p><p>Importantly, Blonder and colleagues</p><p>were cognizant of a number of potential</p><p>sampling biases that might have influ-</p><p>enced their results and found that most of</p><p>their results were robust to these biases.</p><p>The one bias that might have influenced</p><p>their results, however, was the preserva-</p><p>tion sites</p><p>sites</p><p>tended to come from floodplains, whereas</p><p>Paleogene sites were more likely to come</p><p>from channels of</p><p>flowing water. When</p><p>they corrected for this potential bias by</p><p>comparing traits from within each type of</p><p>site, the VD results remained significant,</p><p>but the LMA results were no longer so</p><p>because of low sample sizes. In the end,</p><p>the results showed that changes in VD</p><p>were quite strong and those in LMA</p><p>moderate, showing a clear shift in plant</p><p>functional traits indicating that the K–Pg</p><p>strongly selective,</p><p>mass extinction was</p><p>rather than random,</p><p>in determining its</p><p>victims.</p><p>the leaf economics</p><p>The results from Blonder and colleagues</p><p>indicating that species on the slow-return</p><p>side of</p><p>spectrum</p><p>disproportionately succumbed to extinc-</p><p>tion also suggest some tantalizing, albeit</p><p>speculative, insights into how the ecosys-</p><p>tems in which these species were embed-</p><p>ded may have changed as a result of the</p><p>mass extinction event. The shift towards</p><p>plant communities with a higher propor-</p><p>tion of fast-return species could have led to</p><p>higher rates of ecosystem functioning (e.g.,</p><p>productivity, decomposition rates, and</p><p>water cycling), and this could have fed</p><p>back to influence a number of local and</p><p>global processes. Regardless, by extending</p><p>concepts and tools from modern ecological</p><p>study into the deep past, the study by</p><p>Blonder and colleagues provides a deeper</p><p>understanding of what determines</p><p>the</p><p>winners and losers during a mass extinc-</p><p>tion and may even provide insights into</p><p>the ongoing mass extinction that appears</p><p>to be resulting from the dramatic and</p><p>multifaceted global changes caused by</p><p>humans.</p>
